# CS342
Above and Beyond Python Code

This script is intended to take in two text files, one a list of netids and another a list of partners and their preferences.

This algorithm takes each line of the list of partners and their preferences and performs a series of string manipulations to extract the names of partners (could also just be a single person) and their 3 preferences. The algorithm then takes checks to see the distribution of how many people have already chosen their first, second, and third preferences and places them in the group that has the least members. This is both fair and equitable as it places groups in order (first come first serve) and also ensures that there will be an even distribution of people in each groups (i.e. groups 1-7) so that there aren't just a bunch of people on the same topic.
